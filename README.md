# MyApp
This app was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. The App allows a user to link their google calendar to the app so that any events that occur that day are displayed on the home page. The user must click the authorize button in the side bar and grant MyApp permission to read their google calendar. The app also provides weather information and a timer function. I utilized DOM manipulation to switch between cards/functions so you don't have to reload the page everytime you switch from the different functions of the app. Cookies are utilized to save the user input for the weather function of the app and reload them when the page is loaded. If the user changes the location or the measuring system the cookie is updated with the new information.
